Nox Custom Bible Link Version is a WordPress plugin that simplifies the handling of Bible references on your website. It offers automatic detection and conversion of Bible references into clickable links that display Bible verses in a lightbox. Additionally, you can manually wrap references in `<a>` tags with the class `bible-reference` for custom formatting.

## Features

- Automatic detection and conversion of Bible references.
- Display Bible verses in a lightbox when references are clicked.
- Customizable settings for the lightbox appearance.
- Provides an easy-to-use Gutenberg block for manual reference linking.
- Supports multiple Bible versions and translations.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin ZIP file from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jamesk9526/nox-custom-bible-link).
2. In your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins section.
3. Click "Add New" and then "Upload Plugin."
4. Upload the ZIP file and activate the plugin.

## Usage

### Automatic Reference Detection

The plugin can automatically detect and convert Bible references in your content into clickable links. For example, if you write "John 3:16" in your post or page content, it will be automatically converted into a clickable link.

### Manual Reference Linking

You can manually wrap your Bible references in `<a>` tags with the class `bible-reference` for custom formatting. For example:

```html
<a href="#" class="bible-reference">John 3:16</a>

Gutenberg Block

For more control over how the Bible references are displayed, you can use the provided Gutenberg block. Follow these steps:

    Add a new block in the editor by clicking the "+" button.
    In the search bar, type "Nox Reference Block" and add it to your post or page.
    In the block settings, you can enter your custom text or Bible reference.

Here's how to manually create a Bible reference link using the Gutenberg block:

    Add the "Nox Reference Block" to your content.
    In the block settings, enter your custom text or Bible reference (e.g., "John 3:16").
    The block will generate a clickable link using the entered text or reference.

You can use this Gutenberg block to create customized Bible reference links with specific text or formatting as needed.
Settings

You can configure the plugin settings in the WordPress admin panel. Visit the "Nox Custom Bible Link Version Settings" page to customize the appearance and behavior of the lightbox.
